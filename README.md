# Jam game engine

This is the initial version of the Jam Game Engine (JGE)
It was named after the Global Game Jam 2020 event in which it won the sponsor's award in Plovdiv.
The game that was used to test the engine on the jam is called Beeyond Repair

I will add more info here when I have a more stable version of the engine
